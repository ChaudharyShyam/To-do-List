# To-do list

I crafted a dynamic To-Do List using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, showcasing my skills in web development.

# To Do List Web Application

This repository contains a simple To-Do List web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to add tasks, mark them as completed, and delete tasks.

# Features

1. Add Task: Users can add tasks by entering the task in the input box and clicking the "Add" button.

2. Mark as Completed: Tasks can be marked as completed by clicking on the task. The completed tasks are visually differentiated with a strikethrough effect.

3. Delete Task: Users can delete a task by clicking the "X" button next to the task.

4. Persistence: The application uses local storage to save tasks, ensuring that tasks persist even if the user refreshes the page.
